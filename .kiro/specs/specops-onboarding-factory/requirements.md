# Requirements Document

## Introduction

SpecOps is an AI-powered spec-first onboarding factory that automatically generates comprehensive onboarding materials from repository content. The system analyzes existing Markdown documentation to create structured onboarding tasks, README Quick Start sections, and AI-generated FAQs. It includes dynamic hooks that automatically update documentation when features are created or README files are saved, ensuring onboarding materials stay current and comprehensive.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Automated Onboarding Task Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to automatically generate onboarding tasks from repository content, so that new team members have a structured path to understand and contribute to the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a repository contains Markdown files THEN the system SHALL analyze the content and extract key concepts, setup instructions, and workflow patterns
2. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate structured onboarding tasks in tasks.md format with clear objectives and acceptance criteria
3. WHEN generating tasks THEN the system SHALL prioritize essential setup, core concepts, and hands-on exercises in logical sequence
4. IF multiple Markdown files exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate information and avoid duplicate tasks
5. WHEN tasks are generated THEN the system SHALL include references to source documentation for additional context

### Requirement 2: AI-Powered FAQ Generation

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want AI-generated FAQs based on repository content, so that common questions are proactively addressed in documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN repository Markdown content is analyzed THEN the system SHALL identify potential questions and knowledge gaps
2. WHEN generating FAQs THEN the system SHALL create question-answer pairs that address common developer concerns
3. WHEN FAQ content is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as structured Markdown in faq.md
4. IF existing FAQ content exists THEN the system SHALL merge new content while preserving manual additions
5. WHEN FAQs are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent tone and style following .kiro/steering guidelines

### Requirement 3: Dynamic README Quick Start Generation

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want an automatically updated Quick Start section in the README, so that I can quickly understand how to get started with the project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN README files are saved THEN the system SHALL automatically update the Quick Start section
2. WHEN generating Quick Start content THEN the system SHALL include essential setup steps, basic usage examples, and next steps
3. WHEN updating README THEN the system SHALL preserve existing content outside the Quick Start section
4. IF no Quick Start section exists THEN the system SHALL create one in the appropriate location within the README
5. WHEN Quick Start is generated THEN the system SHALL follow the onboarding style guidelines from .kiro/steering

### Requirement 4: Feature-Created Hook Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want new features to automatically generate corresponding onboarding tasks, so that the onboarding process stays current with project evolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new feature is created THEN the feature-created hook SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN the hook executes THEN the system SHALL analyze the new feature code and documentation
3. WHEN feature analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate relevant onboarding tasks and append them to tasks.md
4. WHEN adding new tasks THEN the system SHALL maintain task numbering and formatting consistency
5. IF the feature includes tests THEN the system SHALL generate tasks that incorporate test-driven learning approaches

### Requirement 5: README-Save Hook Integration

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want README changes to automatically trigger Quick Start and FAQ updates, so that onboarding materials reflect the latest project state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a README file is saved THEN the README-save hook SHALL trigger automatically
2. WHEN the hook executes THEN the system SHALL re-analyze repository content for Quick Start updates
3. WHEN content analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL update both Quick Start section and FAQ content
4. WHEN updating documentation THEN the system SHALL preserve manual edits and additions
5. IF conflicts arise between generated and manual content THEN the system SHALL prioritize manual content and note conflicts

### Requirement 6: Sample Feature Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer learning the system, I want a working hello_world sample feature with tests, so that I can understand the project structure and testing patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is set up THEN it SHALL include a features/hello_world.py sample feature
2. WHEN the sample feature exists THEN it SHALL include corresponding tests/test_hello_world.py
3. WHEN sample code is provided THEN it SHALL demonstrate best practices for the project's coding style
4. WHEN sample tests are provided THEN they SHALL show proper testing patterns and coverage expectations
5. IF the sample feature is modified THEN the system SHALL use it as a reference for generating onboarding tasks

### Requirement 7: Style and Convention Compliance

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want all generated content to follow established style guidelines, so that documentation maintains consistency and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating any content THEN the system SHALL follow code style guidelines from .kiro/steering/code-style.md
2. WHEN creating file structures THEN the system SHALL follow folder structure guidelines from .kiro/steering/structure.md
3. WHEN generating onboarding content THEN the system SHALL follow tone and style guidelines from .kiro/steering/onboarding-style.md
4. IF steering guidelines are updated THEN the system SHALL apply new guidelines to subsequently generated content
5. WHEN style conflicts arise THEN the system SHALL prioritize explicit steering guidelines over default patterns

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Output Generation

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want the system to generate all required specification documents, so that the project follows spec-driven development practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL generate requirements.md with complete feature requirements
2. WHEN requirements are established THEN the system SHALL generate design.md with architectural decisions and component specifications
3. WHEN design is complete THEN the system SHALL generate tasks.md with actionable implementation steps
4. WHEN all core documents exist THEN the system SHALL generate faq.md with AI-powered question-answer pairs
5. WHEN any specification document is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all related documents
